I hope to prepare students to be more thoughtful technologists, able to understand, analyze, and critique the diverse interesections of technology, politics, and society in ways that will be useful beyond their time in the classroom. Whether I am teaching research methods, coding skills, or theory based seminars I strive to make real-world connections and have students apply the material to events and content relevant to their lives. \n\n::: {.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n## R Labs\nLab assignments for Comm 522: Intro to Research Methods (required class for first year grad assignments).
