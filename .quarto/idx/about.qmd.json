My main research interests are technological systems of knowledge production, activism and social movements, and digital inequality. I am also interested in understanding social science better -- particularly in how as a diverse field we decide what questions to pursue and what to use. My dissertation project looks at gender inequality in open knowledge systems like Wikipedia and Open Source Software, and the feminist activism that intervenes within these large gender gaps. I am a computational social scientist with a particular love for network analysis, text analysis, and digital trace data. \n\n\n\nPrior to grad school, I spent a few years working at Girls Who Code in New York City after receiving my B.A. from the University of Chicago. Born and raised in VT, I still identify strongly as a Vermonter despite having lived in 3 very big cities since I left the state. Outside of grad school, I can be found reading novels, making elaborate salads, and walking around the city while listening to gossip podcasts. \n\nYou can find my complete C.V.
