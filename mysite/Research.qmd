# Dissertation Project
## Working Title Digital Inequalities, Feminist Activism, and Open Knowledge Production

In this project I investigate the Irony of Openness: as digital technologies have and strong set of meritocratic norms have made it easier than ever to participate in the creation, maintenance, and archiving of knowledge, extensive gender gaps both among knowledge creators and within content persist. The first part of my dissertation draws on theories of the commons and public sphere to build a framework of openness that operates across different knowledge projects and activist efforts. This framework is crucial for thinking beyond an open/closed dichotomy, instead focusing on openness as a range of negotiated activities and norms. The second half of my dissertation looks at three open knowledge case studies and related cases of feminist knowledge activism in order to empirically demonstrate how openness is negotiated within a community and to evaluate attempts at building more equitable knowledge production processes. 


**The Case Studies** 

1. *Wikipedia and Feminist Edit-a-thons* 
2. *Open Source Software and women led projects* 
3. *Open Science and the emerging citational justice movement* 

As they become available, will update with links to related working papers.

Wikipedia has a well-known gender divide affecting its biographical content. This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities.


 
## Protest Networks, Mobilization, and Resilience

The movement Black Lives Matter has spurred massive, international protests since it first emerged around the eponymous Twitter hashtag in 2013. Social network analysis is well primed to answer questions around how movements like BLM gain traction, create or change story frames, enact policy change, and mobilize supporters, both online and offline. Using BLM as an exemplar, this chapter reviews research about the movement that uses network approaches to understand its emergence, growth, and resilience, especially as it enters its second decade and contends with counter movements. More generally, the chapter offers a discussion of the opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating social media data to the analysis of resilience as it manifests in the growth of networked social movements. 



# Working Papers & Current Projects

## Open Science, Closed Citations (with Mia Jovanova)

The open science (OS) movement developed out of a series of crises within social science fields, among them serious instances of p-hacking and noted replication failures leading to high level retractions that have accompanied a wide-scale crisis in the trust in science (Alberts et al., 2015). The field of Communication has been an active adopter of OS practices as well as site of discussion and critique about how OS fits within the values of a truly multi-method discipline (Fox et al., 2021). Some of the strongest critiques have been directed at the ways that OS might reproduce inequalities within the field, and potentially further mask them under the banner of openness and transparency. While these critiques are important discussions in general, little is known about who is actually participating in OS. The first aim of the paper is to provide an empirical baseline of OS participants within Communication. We also seek to connect OS with another movement to improve scientific quality: citation politics and equity advocates. Since openness should be concerned with who is participating and who is making up the core of the movement, we believe it’s vital to examine the intersection (or potentially, lack there of) of OS and citational politics. Here we provide an empirical description of who is publishing in OS and who they are citing in the hopes that it will drive both conversations forward. We believe a commitment to truly open science requires a commitment to solving citational gender gaps and hope this project will contribute to better, and more equitable, communication research.

We recently presented this work at ICA 2022 in Paris, France (Computational Methods Division) and will have a working paper available soon! You can find the pre-reigstration [here](https://osf.io/f5cn4/registrations).
