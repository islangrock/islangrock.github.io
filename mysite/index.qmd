Hello! 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Le Centre de Recherche sur les Inégalités Sociales (The Center for Research on Social Inequalities) at Sciences Po in Paris, France. At Sciences Po, I'm working with Dr. Jen Schradie to better understand online information environments in the US and France. 

I recieved my PhD from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania in May 2023. My Dissertation, "The Irony of Openness: Gender Inequality in Self-Governed Knowledge Systems" built a framework for investigating gender gaps across different forms of open knowledge production, including Wikipedia and Open Source Software. I evaluated the work of feminist activists intervening in these gaps in order to identify how inequitable forms of knowledge production persist and the strategies through which they can be overcome. My work speaks to the inter-disciplinary domains of digital governance and organization, information environments, and social activism. I'm a computational social scientist with a particular love for network analysis, text analysis, and digital trace data. 

Prior to grad school, I spent a few years working at the education non-profit Girls Who Code in New York City after receiving my B.A. from the University of Chicago. Born and raised in VT, I still identify strongly as a Vermonter despite having lived in four very big cities since I left the state. Outside of grad school, I can be found reading novels, making elaborate salads, and walking around the city while listening to gossip podcasts.
