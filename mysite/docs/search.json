This sudden restriction threw research designs and protocols into disarray: halting ongoing data collection efforts, making replications impossible, and scrambling the ecosystem of software built off of the API. What can this event – the first marker of the “Post API Age” (Freelon, 2018) – tell us about the relationship between data, research questions, and findings?\nClassifying over 70,000 social science abstract between 2006 and 2022 by their method and topic, this project empirically demonstrates how dependent research is on easy, robust, and reliable data access. Preliminary results show that the closure of the Facebook Pages API reduced the computational study of Facebook by more than 50%, attesting to the role of company APIs in shaping social science research.\nI presented preliminary results at a poster at IC2S2 2024 in Philadelphia!\nWorking paper avialble"

    "text": "Gender Inequality in the Open Science Movement\nStemming from my dissertation work, I have two articles that emprically examine gender gaps in the Open Science movement. The first looks specifically at the field of communication while the second looks at the movement leaders who have published work in some way advocating for Open Science practices or related changes in the field.\n\nGender Gaps in Communication’s Open Science Movement\nWith Mia Jovanova (UPenn) Under Review\nWorking paper now available!\n\nCommunication scholarship is increasingly adopting Open Science (OS) practices: sharing code and data, pre-registering studies, and conducting replications. Yet, scholars have also critiqued how the OS movement might create barriers and exacerbate inequalities. As the field aims to better support a more diverse body of scholars, it is imperative to understand who participates in OS. In this pre-registered study, we look at one important area of inequality, author gender, among rates of articles that adopt OS practices versus articles unaffiliated with OS practices. Using computational methods, we categorize author gender and use of OS practices across 4,561 quantitative communication articles. We find prevalent gender gaps, such that women are significantly less likely to lead, and co-author, papers that adopt OS practices relative to papers unaffiliated with OS. These gender gaps are unexplained by journal-level differences or publication year. Our results highlight a tension between the aims of the OS movement and efforts to increase inclusivity in the field. A commitment to truly open science requires a commitment to solving participation gaps. Our work aims to spark a conversation towards better, and more equitable, communication research.\nWe presented this work at ICA 2022 in Paris, France (Computational Methods Division). You can find our pre-registration here.\n\n\nGender Gaps in the Open Science Movement: Participation, Citation, Collaboration\nUnder Review\nThe Open Science movement has become a rising force within the social sciences in the past decade, working to establish and institutionalize more responsible research practices and building a suite of digital tools that help scientists register, access, and share work at each stage of the scientific process. Yet for all the needed reform offered by the Open Science movement, strong critiques have emerged, particularly around how the community and tools built by Open Science advocates works to exclude certain researchers, often those who belong to specific race and gender demographics. Assembling a sample of over 3,000 published articles about the movement or its practices, I investigate rates of gender inequality within the Open Science movement. I identify and quantify a gender gap among (1) published authors, (2) within citations, and (3) within the co-authorship network. Additionally, using simulated co-authorship networks, I gauge the effects citing more women, a common recommendation from the citational justice movement, would have for gender equity within the Open Science movement. This work sheds light on the development and growth of Open Science within the social sciences and provides empirical evidence of gender gaps in participation and citation."

Book banning and other forms of information censorship have serious implications for democratic processes, and censorship has become a central theme of partisan political rhetoric in the United States. However, there is little empirical work on the exact content, predictors of, and repercussions of this rise in book bans. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2,532 bans that occurred during the 2021–2022 school year from PEN America, combined with county-level administrative data, multiple book-level digital trace datasets, restricted-use book sales data, and a new crowd-sourced dataset of author demographic information, we find that (i) banned books are disproportionately written by people of color and feature characters of color, both fictional and historical, in children’s books; (ii) right-leaning counties that have become less conservative over time are more likely to ban books than neighboring counties; and (iii) national and state levels of interest in books are largely unaffected after they are banned. Together, these results suggest that rather than serving primarily as a censorship tactic, book banning in this recent US context, targeted at low-interest children’s books featuring diverse characters, is more similar to symbolic political action to galvanize shrinking voting blocs.\nThis project is funded by a grant from the Social Science Research Council."

    "text": "The Irony of Openness: Gender Inequality in Self-Governed Knowledge Systems\nDissertation Project\nOpen knowledge technologies are in many ways the backbone of the Internet, providing reliable information and tools for millions of people every day, often without their awareness. Yet across sites of open knowledge technologies, gender gaps persist and exceed the rates of gender inequality in more closed systems of knowledge production. I deem this pattern the irony of openness. To connect across a range of endeavors I construct a definition of openness applicable to a range of products and participation types. Using a framework of self-governance, I identify the complex set of traits and practices that produce openness and in turn determine the quality of our informational tools and content. Using digital trace data from the processes of knowledge production across three case studies –Wikipedia, Open Source Software, and the Open Science Movement – I both identify repeating forms of gender inequality and evaluate activists attempts to intervene and produce more equitable knowledge. My results indicate both profound gender gaps and document the difficult work of creating change in the governance of open knowledge technologies."

This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities."

(2023) – with Sandra González-Bailón (UPenn)\nAvailable here\n The movement Black Lives Matter has spurred massive, international protests since it first emerged around the eponymous Twitter hashtag in 2013. Social network analysis is well primed to answer questions around how movements like BLM gain traction, create or change story frames, enact policy change, and mobilize supporters, both online and offline. Using BLM as an exemplar, this chapter reviews research about the movement that uses network approaches to understand its emergence, growth, and resilience, especially as it enters its second decade and contends with counter movements. More generally, the chapter offers a discussion of the opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating social media data to the analysis of resilience as it manifests in the growth of networked social movements."
