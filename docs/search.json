    "text": "Hello!\nI am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Le Centre de Recherche sur les Inégalités Sociales (The Center for Research on Social Inequalities) at Sciences Po in Paris, France. At Sciences Po, I’m working with Dr. Jen Schradie to better understand online information environments in the US and France.\nI recieved my PhD from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania in May 2023. My Dissertation, “The Irony of Openness: Gender Inequality in Self-Governed Knowledge Systems” built a framework for investigating gender gaps across different forms of open knowledge production, including Wikipedia and Open Source Software. I evaluated the work of feminist activists intervening in these gaps in order to identify how inequitable forms of knowledge production persist and the strategies through which they can be overcome. My work speaks to the inter-disciplinary domains of digital governance and organization, information environments, and social activism. I’m a computational social scientist with a particular love for network analysis, text analysis, and digital trace data.\nPrior to grad school, I spent a few years working at the education non-profit Girls Who Code in New York City after receiving my B.A. from the University of Chicago. Born and raised in VT, I still identify strongly as a Vermonter despite having lived in four very big cities since I left the state. Outside of grad school, I can be found reading novels, making elaborate salads, and walking around the city while listening to gossip podcasts.\nLooking for my university profile instead? This way!"

The first part of my dissertation draws on theories of the commons and public sphere to build a framework of openness that operates across different knowledge projects and activist efforts. This framework is crucial for thinking beyond an open/closed dichotomy, instead focusing on openness as a range of negotiated activities and norms. The second half of my dissertation looks at three open knowledge case studies and related cases of feminist knowledge activism in order to empirically demonstrate how openness is negotiated within a community and to evaluate attempts at building more equitable knowledge production processes.\nThe Case Studies\n\nWikipedia and Feminist Edit-a-thons\nOpen Source Software and women led projects\nOpen Science and the emerging citational justice movement"

    "text": "The Gender Divide in Wikipedia: Quantifying and Assessing the Impact of Two Feminist Interventions\nJournal of Communication (2022) – with Sandra González-Bailón\nPaper here\nVideo presentation here\n\nWikipedia has a well-known gender divide affecting its biographical content. This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities."

Social network analysis is well primed to answer questions around how movements like BLM gain traction, create or change story frames, enact policy change, and mobilize supporters, both online and offline. Using BLM as an exemplar, this chapter reviews research about the movement that uses network approaches to understand its emergence, growth, and resilience, especially as it enters its second decade and contends with counter movements. More generally, the chapter offers a discussion of the opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating social media data to the analysis of resilience as it manifests in the growth of networked social movements."

    "text": "Open Science, Closed Citations\n\nWith Mia Jovanova (UPenn)\nWorking paper now available!\n\nCommunication scholarship is increasingly adopting Open Science (OS) practices: sharing code and data, pre-registering studies, and conducting replications. Yet, scholars have also critiqued how the OS movement might create barriers and exacerbate inequalities. As the field aims to better support a more diverse body of scholars, it is imperative to understand who participates in OS. In this pre-registered study, we look at one important area of inequality, author gender, among rates of articles that adopt OS practices versus articles unaffiliated with OS practices. Using computational methods, we categorize author gender and use of OS practices across 4,561 quantitative communication articles. We find prevalent gender gaps, such that women are significantly less likely to lead, and co-author, papers that adopt OS practices relative to papers unaffiliated with OS. These gender gaps are unexplained by journal-level differences or publication year. Our results highlight a tension between the aims of the OS movement and efforts to increase inclusivity in the field. A commitment to truly open science requires a commitment to solving participation gaps. Our work aims to spark a conversation towards better, and more equitable, communication research.\nWe presented this work at ICA 2022 in Paris, France (Computational Methods Division). You can find our pre-registration here."

    "text": "Editing Together: Labor, Governence, and Activism on Wikipedia\nWorking Paper – Coming Soon!\nWikipedia’s gender gap is well documented, with large discrepancies identified among both editors and within content. Several initiatives have begun to intervene in theses gender gaps, prompting new ways of considering Wikipedia’s governance and systems of editing. In this article, I study the manuals and trainings of three different feminist editing movements and identify their specific approaches to labor, governance, and inequality. Combining literature from labor theorists and platform governance, I argue that these groups focus on adding and editing content, often through new types of labor structures, but largely ignore intervening within Wikipedia’s governance structures. While they propose a form of editing together that is often at odds with the typical Wikipedia individualism, the group’s insistence on following Wikipedia’s rules perpetuates potentially biased standards. I conclude by identifying Wikipedia’s own edict of “No firm rules” as a potential avenue for stronger stances around policy change. This article sheds light into the labor of feminist editors and how social movements can impact governance structures of large organizations."

    "text": "Banned Books\n\nWith Katie Spoon (U Colorado Boulder), Jack LaViolette (Columbia), and Marcelo Silva (Duke)\nIn the 2021-2022 school year, more books were banned in U.S. school districts than in any previous year. Book banning and other forms of censorship have been shown to have serious consequences on democracy, and censorship is an especially relevant concern in the current U.S. political climate. However, there is little empirical work on the nature of the book bans. In particular, we have three aims: to identify patterns in (1) the types of books and authors who are the subject of the bans, (2) the districts that ban books, and (3) how attention around a book shifts once the book is banned. To meet these aims we combine PEN America’s list of 1,586 book bans in the US, self-identified author demographic information for the nearly 800 authors of the books, U.S. school district metadata, and several digital trace data sets, including Google Books profiles, Google Trends, Goodreads reviews, and Twitter discussions. This research contributes to our understanding of the renewed vigor around book bans and seeks to better contextualize its effects in our digitally mediated information environment.\nThis project is funded by a grant from the Social Science Research Council."
