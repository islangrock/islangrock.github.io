I hope to prepare students to be more thoughtful technologists, able to understand, analyze, and critique the diverse interesections of technology, politics, and society in ways that will be useful beyond their time in the classroom. Whether I am teaching research methods, coding skills, or theory based seminars I strive to make real-world connections and have students apply the material to events and content relevant to their lives."

The first part of my dissertation draws on theories of the commons and public sphere to build a framework of openness that operates across different knowledge projects and activist efforts. This framework is crucial for thinking beyond an open/closed dichotomy, instead focusing on openness as a range of negotiated activities and norms. The second half of my dissertation looks at three open knowledge case studies and related cases of feminist knowledge activism in order to empirically demonstrate how openness is negotiated within a community and to evaluate attempts at building more equitable knowledge production processes.\nThe Case Studies\n\nWikipedia and Feminist Edit-a-thons\nOpen Source Software and women led projects\nOpen Science and the emerging citational justice movement\n\nAs they become available, will update with links to related working papers."

    "text": "The Gender Divide in Wikipedia: Quantifying and Assessing the Impact of Two Feminist Interventions\nJournal of Communication (2022) – with Sandra González-Bailón\nPaper here\nVideo presentation here\n\nWikipedia has a well-known gender divide affecting its biographical content. This bias not only shapes social perceptions of knowledge, but it can also propagate beyond the platform as its contents are leveraged to correct misinformation, train machine-learning tools, and enhance search engine results. What happens when feminist movements intervene to try to close existing gaps? Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects. We find that the interventions are successful at adding content about women that would otherwise be missing, but they are less successful at addressing structural biases that limit the visibility of that content. This leads us to argue for a more granular and cumulative analysis of gender gaps in collaborative environments. We also discuss the implications for future scholarship on digital inequalities."

Social network analysis is well primed to answer questions around how movements like BLM gain traction, create or change story frames, enact policy change, and mobilize supporters, both online and offline. Using BLM as an exemplar, this chapter reviews research about the movement that uses network approaches to understand its emergence, growth, and resilience, especially as it enters its second decade and contends with counter movements. More generally, the chapter offers a discussion of the opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating social media data to the analysis of resilience as it manifests in the growth of networked social movements."

    "text": "Open Science, Closed Citations (with Mia Jovanova)\nThe open science (OS) movement developed out of a series of crises within social science fields, among them serious instances of p-hacking and noted replication failures leading to high level retractions that have accompanied a wide-scale crisis in the trust in science (Alberts et al., 2015). The field of Communication has been an active adopter of OS practices as well as site of discussion and critique about how OS fits within the values of a truly multi-method discipline (Fox et al., 2021). Some of the strongest critiques have been directed at the ways that OS might reproduce inequalities within the field, and potentially further mask them under the banner of openness and transparency. While these critiques are important discussions in general, little is known about who is actually participating in OS. The first aim of the paper is to provide an empirical baseline of OS participants within Communication. We also seek to connect OS with another movement to improve scientific quality: citation politics and equity advocates. Since openness should be concerned with who is participating and who is making up the core of the movement, we believe it’s vital to examine the intersection (or potentially, lack there of) of OS and citational politics. Here we provide an empirical description of who is publishing in OS and who they are citing in the hopes that it will drive both conversations forward. We believe a commitment to truly open science requires a commitment to solving citational gender gaps and hope this project will contribute to better, and more equitable, communication research.\nWe recently presented this work at ICA 2022 in Paris, France (Computational Methods Division) and will have a working paper available soon! You can find the pre-reigstration here."

My main research interests are digital inequality, systems of knowledge production, and social movements. My dissertation project combines all three of these interests and seeks to understand how feminist knowledge activists intervene within the wide gender gaps that exist in open knowledge systems like Wikipedia and Open Source Software. My work speaks to the inter-disciplinary domains of digital governance and organization, information environments, and social activism. I’m a computational social scientist with a particular love for network analysis, text analysis, and digital trace data.\nPrior to grad school, I spent a few years working at the education non-profit Girls Who Code in New York City after receiving my B.A. from the University of Chicago. Born and raised in VT, I still identify strongly as a Vermonter despite having lived in three very big cities since I left the state. Outside of grad school, I can be found reading novels, making elaborate salads, and walking around the city while listening to gossip podcasts.\nLooking for my university profile instead? This way!"
